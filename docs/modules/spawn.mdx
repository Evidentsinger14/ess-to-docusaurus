:::warning
This addon requires you to have a matching version of EssentialsX installed.

[Vault](https://github.com/milkbowl/Vault) is required for any group related functionalities documented below.

EssentialsX Spawn lets you control where players spawn both when they first join the server and when they die.
You can use the in-game `/setspawn` command to set a spawn location for everyone on your server as well as for specific groups.

## Configuration
You can access the EssentialsSpawn configuration by opening `/plugins/Essentials/config.yml`, and navigate to the section labeled "EssentialsX Spawn".

These are the settings for first time joining players.
This setting controls the message that will be announced to the server when someone logs in for the first time.
Set `announce-format: ''` to disable.
```yaml
newbies:
  announce-format: '&dWelcome {DISPLAYNAME}&d to the server!'
```
This setting controls the spawnpoint users will be placed to when they join for the first time. Set `spawnpoint: "none"` if you'd like to use the spawn point of the world.
```yaml
  spawnpoint: newbies
```
You can give users a kit on first join. This kit will be given regardless of cost and permissions, and will not trigger the kit delay.
Set `kit: ''` to disable.
```yaml
  kit: tools
```
What priority should we use for handling respawns? Changes will not apply until after the server is restarted.
Accepts the following values:
- `none`: use vanilla respawning behaviour.
- `lowest`: allow Multiverse to handle the respawning.
- `high`: allow EssentialsSpawn to handle the respawning.
- `highest`: force EssentialsSpawn to handle the respawning.
```yaml
respawn-listener-priority: high
```
What priority should we use for handling spawning on joining the server? Changing this may impact or break
`spawn-on-join` functionality. Changes will not apply until after the server is restarted.
Accepts the same values as `respawn-listener-priority` above.
```yaml
spawn-join-listener-priority: high
```

When users die, should they respawn at their first home or bed instead of the spawnpoint?
```yaml
respawn-at-home: false
```
When users die, should they respawn at their bed instead of the spawnpoint? The value of `respawn-at-home` has to be true.
```yaml
respawn-at-home-bed: true
```
When users die, should EssentialsSpawn respect users' respawn anchors?
```yaml
respawn-at-anchor: false
```

Force joining players to be teleported to the spawnpoint. This setting also accepts Vault group values, or a list of group values.

Users can be exempt from being teleported to spawn on join with the `essentials.spawn-on-join.exempt` permission.
```yaml
spawn-on-join: false
# All players in group `guests` will be teleported to spawn when joining the server.
#spawn-on-join: guests
# All players in group `guests` and `admin` are to be teleported to spawn when joining.
#spawn-on-join:
#- guests
#- admin
```

## Configuring Group Spawns

EssentialsSpawn allows you to create spawnpoints on a per-group basis using the `/setspawn <group>` command. The
`/setspawn <group>` command sets your current position as the spawn point for the specified Vault group.

Example: `/setspawn vip` will set your current position as the spawn point for the "vip" Vault group.

:::note
[Vault](https://github.com/milkbowl/Vault) and a supported permissions plugin, such as
[LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) are required for this.
