title: Anti-Build
---

:::warning
This addon requires you to have a matching version of EssentialsX installed.
:::

EssentialsX AntiBuild provides fine control over player interactions on your server through a permission-based system.
You can specify which blocks and items players can use, restrict building entirely, and manage crafting and block
interactions. It also features an alert system to notify admins when certain items are used.

:::note
EssentialsAntiBuild does not include any kind of region protection. To restrict building in specific regions we
recommend installing [WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard) instead.
:::

:::note
We recommend you use [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) with AntiBuild to make the most of its features.
:::

## Configuration
You can access the EssentialsAntiBuild configuration by opening `/plugins/Essentials/config.yml`, and scrolling down
until you see the section marked "EssentialsX AntiBuild".

Control whether players without the `essentials.build` permission can build. Set to true to prevent building from
players without this permission. Set to false to allow all players to build regardless of permissions.

```yaml
build: true
```

Control whether players without the `essentials.build` permission can use items. Set to true to prevent using items from
players without this permission. Set to false to allow all players to use items regardless of permissions.

```yaml
use: true
```

EssentialsAntiBuild will warn players when they are not allowed to build. Set to false to disable.

```yaml
warn-on-build-disallow: true
```

Players with the `essentials.protect.alerts` permission will receive notifications when certain blocks trigger alerts.
Specify the block types for which you want to receive alerts:

`on-placement`: Blocks that will trigger alerts when placed.

`on-use`: Items that will trigger alerts when used.

`on-break`: Blocks that will trigger alerts when broken.

:::info You can find a complete list of items [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html).
:::

:::note
Exempt users from triggering alerts with the `essentials.protect.alerts.notrigger` permission.
:::

```yaml
alert:
  on-placement: LAVA,TNT,LAVA_BUCKET
  on-use: LAVA_BUCKET
  on-break:
```

These are the configurations that allow you to list types of blocks to be blocked server wide.

```yaml
blacklist:

  # Which blocks should people be prevented from placing?
  placement: LAVA,TNT,LAVA_BUCKET

  # Which items should people be prevented from using?
  usage: LAVA_BUCKET

  # Which blocks should people be prevented from breaking?
  break:

  # Which blocks should not be moved by pistons?
  piston:

  # Which blocks should not be dispensed by dispensers
  dispenser:
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why can't players build after installing EssentialsXAntiBuild?

A: AntiBuild, out-of-the-box, restricts building, block interactions, and item usage for players without sufficient
permissions. If you wish to change this behavior, set `build: false` in your config, grant users sufficient permissions,
or uninstall this module altogether.
