## Developer API

EssentialsX Discord Link has a simple API to provide very simple methods to check if players are linked,
link players, unlink players, and to get linked player data.

Outside the specific examples below, you can also view javadocs for EssentialsX Discord Link
[here](https://jd-v2.essentialsx.net/EssentialsDiscordLink).

### Get a linked player's Discord tag

The following example shows how to get a linked player's Discord tag (in `Name#0000` format) or null if the player
isn't linked.

```java
public String getDiscordTag(final Player player) {
    // Gets the API service for EssentialsX Discord Link
    final DiscordLinkService linkApi = Bukkit.getServicesManager().load(DiscordLinkService.class);

    final String discordId = linkApi.getDiscordId(player.getUniqueId());
    if (discordId == null) {
        return null;
    }

    // Gets the API service for EssentialsX Discord which we will use to get the actual user
    final DiscordService discordApi = Bukkit.getServicesManager().load(DiscordService.class);

    final InteractionMember member = discordApi.getMemberById(discordId).join();
    return member == null ? null : member.getTag();
}
```
