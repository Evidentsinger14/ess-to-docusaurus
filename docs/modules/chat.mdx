:::warning
This addon requires you to have a matching version of EssentialsX installed.
:::

EssentialsX Chat is a lightweight chat formatter offering basic features. It allows you to customize chat formatting on
your server by adding prefixes, suffixes and colors in chat, as well as setting different formats for different groups.

## Configuration
You can access the EssentialsChat configuration by opening `/plugins/Essentials/config.yml`, and scrolling down until
you see the section marked "EssentialsX Chat".

In Vanilla Minecraft, all players can see all other player messages. This setting will change the number of blocks (In
a radius) messages can be viewed from. Set to 0 to make all chat global.

::::note
Users with the `essentials.chat.spy` permission will see everything, regardless of this setting.

Users with `essentials.chat.shout` can override this by prefixing their message with an exclamation mark (!).

Users with `essentials.chat.question` can override this by prefixing their message with a question mark (?).

:::info
You can add command costs for shout/question by adding `chat-shout` and `chat-question` to the command costs section.
:::
::::

```yaml
chat:
  radius: 0
```

:::note
[Vault](https://github.com/milkbowl/Vault) is required if you wish to retrieve prefixes or suffixes from a permission manager, or use group based formatting.
:::

These configurations define the global chat format, controlling the appearance of chat messages. You can use the
following placeholders:

```yaml
  format: '<{DISPLAYNAME}> {MESSAGE}'
  #format: '&7[{GROUP}]&r {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&r {MESSAGE}'
  #format: '&7{PREFIX}&r {DISPLAYNAME}&r &7{SUFFIX}&r: {MESSAGE}'
```

EssentialsX Chat allows you to define different chat formats for each group. Ensure that the names you use in this
section exactly match those in your permission manager, as they are case-sensitive.

:::note
If you have a group displayname set in LuckPerms, use that instead of the group name itself.
:::

```yaml
  group-formats:
  #  default: '{WORLDNAME} {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&r {MESSAGE}'
  #  admins: '{WORLDNAME} &c[{GROUP}]&r {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&c {MESSAGE}'
```


With world aliases, you are able to set custom text that is displayed in chat when using the `{WORLD}` keyword.
```yaml
  world-aliases:
  #  plots: "&dP&r"
  #  creative: "&eC&r"
```

Whether players should be placed into shout mode by default.
```yaml
  shout-default: false
```

Whether a player's shout mode should persist between server restarts.
```yaml
  persist-shout: false
```

Whether chat questions should be enabled or not.
```yaml
  question-enabled: true
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Does EssentialsX Chat support PlaceholderAPI?

A: No, but that is something we plan to support in the future!

___

Q: Why is my prefix, username and suffix all pushed together with no spaces.

A: By default, the `{DISPLAYNAME}` keyword combines your Prefix, Username/Nickname, and Suffix together as it is received from Vault.
To get around this, you may have to change your chat format to use the keywords of your choice, uncomment `add-prefix-suffix`, and set it to false.

___

Q: Why is am I seeing double prefixes/suffixes in chat?

A: Using the `{PREFIX}` and/or `{SUFFIX}` keywords along with `{DISPLAYNAME}` may cause double prefixes/suffixes to be shown in chat, unless the `add-prefix-suffix` is uncommented and set to false.
