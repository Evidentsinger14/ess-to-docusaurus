EssentialsX Chat is a basic chat formatting addon for EssentialsX.


## Configuration
You can access the EssentialsChat configuration by opening `/plugins/Essentials/config.yml`, and scrolling down until you see the section marked "EssentialsX Chat"

```yaml
chat:
  radius: 0
```
In Vanilla Minecraft, all players can see all other player messages. This setting will change the number of blocks (In a radius) the message can be viewed from.

```yaml
  format: '<{DISPLAYNAME}> {MESSAGE}'
  #format: '&7[{GROUP}]&r {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&r {MESSAGE}'
  #format: '&7{PREFIX}&r {DISPLAYNAME}&r &7{SUFFIX}&r: {MESSAGE}'
```
These are the configurations for a global chat format. This is how your chat messages will be displayed when a player types in the server chat.

```yaml
  group-formats:
  #  default: '{WORLDNAME} {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&r {MESSAGE}'
  #  admins: '{WORLDNAME} &c[{GROUP}]&r {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&c {MESSAGE}'
```
You can set formats per group in EssentialsX Chat. make sure that the name you use in this section matches exactly what you have in your permission manager
:::important
If you have a group displayname set in LuckPerms, use that instead of the group name itself
:::

```yaml
  world-aliases:
  #  plots: "&dP&r"
  #  creative: "&eC&r"
```
With world aliases, you are able to set custom text that is displayed in chat when using the `{WORLD}` keyword.

```yaml
  shout-default: false
```
Whether players should be placed into shout mode by default.

```yaml
  persist-shout: false
```
Whether a player's shout mode should persist restarts.

```yaml
  question-enabled: true
```
Whether chat questions should be enabled or not.

## __Frequently Asked Questions__
Q: Does EssentialsX Chat support PlaceholderAPI?

A: No, but that is something we plan to support in the future!

___

Q: Why is my prefix, username and suffix all pushed together with no spaces.

A: By default, the `{DISPLAYNAME}` keyword combines your Prefix, Username/Nickname, and Suffix together as it is received from Vault.
To get around this, you may have to change your chat format to use the keywords of your choice, uncomment `add-prefix-suffix`, and set it to false.
