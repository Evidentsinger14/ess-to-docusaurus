EssentialsX Chat is a basic chat formatting addon for EssentialsX.


## Configuration
You can access the EssentialsChat configuration by opening `/plugins/Essentials/config.yml`, and scrolling down until you see the section marked "EssentialsX Chat"

In Vanilla Minecraft, all players can see all other player messages. This setting will change the number of blocks (In a radius) the message can be viewed from.
```yaml
chat:
  radius: 0
```

These are the configurations for a global chat format. This is how your chat messages will be displayed when a player types in the server chat.
```yaml
  format: '<{DISPLAYNAME}> {MESSAGE}'
  #format: '&7[{GROUP}]&r {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&r {MESSAGE}'
  #format: '&7{PREFIX}&r {DISPLAYNAME}&r &7{SUFFIX}&r: {MESSAGE}'
```

You can set formats per group in EssentialsX Chat. make sure that the name you use in this section matches exactly what you have in your permission manager
```yaml
  group-formats:
  #  default: '{WORLDNAME} {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&r {MESSAGE}'
  #  admins: '{WORLDNAME} &c[{GROUP}]&r {DISPLAYNAME}&7:&c {MESSAGE}'
```
:::important
If you have a group displayname set in LuckPerms, use that instead of the group name itself
:::

With world aliases, you are able to set custom text that is displayed in chat when using the `{WORLD}` keyword.
```yaml
  world-aliases:
  #  plots: "&dP&r"
  #  creative: "&eC&r"
```

Whether players should be placed into shout mode by default.
```yaml
  shout-default: false
```

Whether a player's shout mode should persist restarts.
```yaml
  persist-shout: false
```

Whether chat questions should be enabled or not.
```yaml
  question-enabled: true
```

## __Frequently Asked Questions__
Q: Does EssentialsX Chat support PlaceholderAPI?

A: No, but that is something we plan to support in the future!

___

Q: Why is my prefix, username and suffix all pushed together with no spaces.

A: By default, the `{DISPLAYNAME}` keyword combines your Prefix, Username/Nickname, and Suffix together as it is received from Vault.
To get around this, you may have to change your chat format to use the keywords of your choice, uncomment `add-prefix-suffix`, and set it to false.

___

Q: Why is am I seeing double prefixes/suffixes in chat?

A: Using the `{PREFIX}` and/or `{SUFFIX}` keywords along with `{DISPLAYNAME}` may cause double prefixes/suffixes to be shown in chat, unless the `add-prefix-suffix` is uncommented and set to false.
