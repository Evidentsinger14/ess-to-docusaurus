title: Home Limits Guide
---

:::warning Make sure you have a permissions plugin installed
Before proceeding with this guide, you're required to be using a permission manager. We recommend using
[LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), if you don't have one.
:::

EssentialsX allows you to manage the maximum number of homes a player can set by defining permissions associated with
different sethome ranks, also known as *sets*.

<!-- Not a huge fan of how this paragraph turned out. Feel free to propose adjustments. -->
This is achieved through the `sethome-multiple` setting in the plugin configuration allowing you to create home sets,
which are essentially key-value pairs, corresponding home groups with their respective home limits.

<!-- The steps approach below is inspired by Jason's original "How to set EssentialsX home limits" guide. Do
we want to stick with that approach or do something different? -->
## Steps

1. Open your EssentialsX configuration file `/plugins/Essentials/config.yml` and locate the `sethome-multiple` setting
under the Homes section.

<!-- We could improve the transition and explanation for this step, as well as for the subsequent ones. -->
2. Create a name and set a limit for that name. Remember, the name has nothing to do with group names, so it can be
called whatever you want as long as the permission name matches.

You can define the default amount of homes using the default set below.

:::info
Grant players unlimited homes by assigning them the `essentials.sethome.multiple.unlimited` permission.
:::
```yaml
sethome-multiple:
  default: 3
  vip: 5
  staff: 10
```

3. Give the desired group or user the following permission nodes:
- `essentials.sethome` - Allows access to the /sethome command.
- `essentials.sethome.multiple` - Allows access to multiple homes.
- `essentials.sethome.multiple.[set name]` - Raises the home limit to the set value defined in the config.

## Example

```yaml
sethome-multiple:
  default: 2
  regulars: 3
```

In this example, a player with the `essentials.sethome` and `essentials.sethome.multiple` permissions will be able to
set up to 2 homes, which is the default value.

A player with the `essentials.sethome`, `essentials.sethome.multiple` and `essentials.sethome.multiple.regulars` permissions
will be able to set up to 3 homes.
